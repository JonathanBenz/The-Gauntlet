# The-Gauntlet
The Gauntlet is a series of minigames (Russian Roulette, Rock Paper Scissors, Type Race, Click the Button, Trivia, and Blackjack) where you have to proceed through each game without fail to reach the very end. Make one mistake and you start over from the very beginning. 

Known Bugs: 1) In Type Race, you can just copy and paste the text. 
            2) In Blackjack, there is a bug where the opponent's cards do not add up correctly.
